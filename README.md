**NOTES ON INITIAL LOAD:**
- remember to run the startup.sh script in the terminal, to fix the README.md file
  ```console
  bash ./config/startup.sh
  ```
- if you are coding in C/C++
  - when you run or debug a C/C++ program for the first time, the IDE will ask what compiler to use; select the 1st choice (C/C++: g++)
  - the IDE will place a task.json file in the .vscode directory

**REMEMBER:**
- ensure you commit your code after every major change, to keep your history
```console
  git add -A
  git commit -m "𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑡 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒"
  git push origin main
```
